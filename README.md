Version history
* v1.0
    * Decompiled from the ManHunt jar file on the a#m Server
* v1.1
    * New items are added. All the new items through 1.12 have been added, including glazed terracotta, shulker shells, purpur blocks, concrete, etc.
    * All items should provide awards in your inventory. In the past, a couple items wouldn't provide the award (e.g., doors) - this has been fixed.
    * Items are split out by realm. Right now we haven't accessed the End, so no End items will be awarded. This is configurable by staff (IOW, it's not automatic, and the choice of staff).
    * Some items have limits on how many will be awarded. For example, no more getting a stack of 42 nether stars or beacons - you'll only get 1-3 now.
    * Skulls will be awarded, but they are always skeleton skulls. Talk to staff to get those swapped out for your chosen type.
* v1.1.1
    * /mhtarget will tell you who the current huntee is and how long you have to find them
* v1.1.2
    * Enchanted prizes can have more than one enchantment on them.
    * Potions and splash potions have effects
* v1.1.2.1
    * Added more potion entries to the prize list - one for each potion type
    * [Bug] - didn't have potions in a used list

Possible further enhancements:
* actual enchanted books
* dyes (intercept "INK_SAC" and turn it  into a different type of dye)
* if inventory is full, drop the stack at the player's feet
