* v1.1
    * New items are added. All the new items through 1.12 have been added, including glazed terracotta, shulker shells, purpur blocks, concrete, etc.
    * All items should provide awards in your inventory. In the past, a couple items wouldn't provide the award (e.g., doors) - this has been fixed.
    * Items are split out by realm. Right now we haven't accessed the End, so no End items will be awarded. This is configurable by staff (IOW, it's not automatic, and the choice of staff).
    * Some items have limits on how many will be awarded. For example, no more getting a stack of 42 nether stars or beacons - you'll only get 1-3 now.
    * Skulls will be awarded, but they are always skeleton skulls. Talk to staff to get those swapped out for your chosen type.
* v1.0
    * Decompiled from the ManHunt jar file on the a#m Server

Possible further enhancements:
* actual enchanted books
